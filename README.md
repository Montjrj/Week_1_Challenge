## Description
The motivation behind this project is to promote digital inclusivity and ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to online information and services. It addresses the problem of inaccessible websites, which can pose significant barriers for individuals with disabilities when trying to navigate and interact with online content. 

This project was built with the intention of bridging this accessibility gap by implementing features such as video captions for the hearing-impaired, screen reader compatibility for the visually impaired, and support for braille keyboards to facilitate easy navigation and interaction. By doing so, it aims to make the internet a more inclusive and equitable space, allowing everyone, regardless of their abilities, to fully participate in the digital world.
